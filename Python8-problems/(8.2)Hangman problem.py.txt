# Write a txt file which has a word in each line like:
# Hands
# Legs
# India
# Crow
# Rain


# Write a python code to read the file and store the words in the list
# Write a function to guess a word randomly from the list.

# Now, write a function which asks user to guess the chosen word letter by letter.
# Show "incorrect" message to the wrong guessed letter. 
# Display  letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly. 

# Let say word is EVAPORATE
'''
>>> Welcome to Hangman!
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
>>> Guess your letter: S
Incorrect!
You left with 5 chances to guess.

>>> Guess your letter: E
E _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E
...
And so on.
'''

# 1)Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
# Keep track of the letters the user guessed.
# 2) If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
# 3)When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
